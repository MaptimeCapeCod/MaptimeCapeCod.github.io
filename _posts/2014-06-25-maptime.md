This is our first Maptime Boston meetup! Come share ideas about how we can
learn mapmaking together.

New to web maps? At the first Maptime Boston, we'll talk about the basic
components and technology of web maps, and how to get started making your own
maps. Experienced with web maps? Come lend your expertise! Beginners are
encouraged, and be sure bring your laptop.
