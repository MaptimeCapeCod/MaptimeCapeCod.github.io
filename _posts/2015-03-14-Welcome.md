title: Welcome to Maptime Cape Cod!
---

Maptime Cape Cod is a monthly meetup where members can teach and learn about different geospatial technologies, work collaboratively on projects, and showcase their mapping successes. Suffice it to say, maptime is a time for maps. We encourage an open learning environment for anyone regardless of experience. That said, we encourage anyone to attend one of our meetups that are interested in the topic and/or geospatial information. At its core, Maptime is all about learning from our peers to build a community of modern day cartography on and around Cape Cod.

We anticipate that Maptime Cape Cod will meet monthly at various locations around the Cape and possibly the south coast.
