title: October Maptime - Show and Tell!
---

Last week's Maptime was a show and tell night. A dozen or so people gave short demonstrations or presentations of maps and other projects they're working on. It was fun to see what everyone is up to, especially when people showed off things they had learned at previous Maptime events!

Abishek presented some reasearch on [Who Uses OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/dalek2point3/diary/24117). He also shared this [map](http://cheerfulguy.cartodb.com/viz/92444318-5a33-11e4-a1d9-0e018d66dc29/public_map) to go along with it.

Jerrad showed two projects: the [Camberville Green Map](http://cambridgema.greenmap.org) and [Ecological Footprint](http://pthbb.org/natural/footprint/) maps.

Tim spoke about his [work with Azavea's Summer of Maps](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xqk83iq5yctb1qg/CDC_LightningTalk.pdf?dl=0) program.

Sean talked about what's happening with [Cambridge GIS data](http://www.cambridgema.gov/GIS/gisdatadictionary), which is [available on GitHub](http://cambridgegis.github.io/gisdata.html). He also showed a couple of cool maps, including this [fall foliage map](http://www.cambridgema.gov/theworks/ourservices/urbanforestry/treeinventory/FallFoliageMap.aspx).

Cristen couldn't make it but wanted to be sure we were all aware of this [fun map](http://tilde.club/~javi/).

Ornoth showed his work on a personal [cycling heat map](http://www.ornoth.com/bicycling/heatmap.php). Read more about it [here](http://ornoth-cycling.livejournal.com/79723.html).

Andy sought ideas for good ways to map Hubway bicycle/station availability as an update to an [older project](http://bostonography.com/2013/mapping-hubway-availability/).

Jake presented two maps of Cambridge parking ticket data: a [heat map](http://jwass.github.io/cambridgetickets/heat.html) and a [binned map](http://jwass.github.io/cambridgetickets/density.html). He has some [code and explanation](https://github.com/jwass/cambridgetickets) to go along with them.

Nick showed two maps he made at RunKeeper, analyzing [when people run](http://data.runkeeper.com/rk-country-weekly-running-habits), and [speed, distance, and frequency](http://data.runkeeper.com/rk-usa-running-stats-by-state).

Mike gave us a look at a realtime map of shipping vessels, which he is unable to post publicly, but he has shared some [code that helps with the realtime mapping](https://github.com/mikeatlas/realtime-rails).

Guido talked about some of his "quick and dirty" mapping methods for [mapping.place](http://mapping.place).

*Thanks to everyone who shared their work! We all look forward to another show and tell night in the future!*
