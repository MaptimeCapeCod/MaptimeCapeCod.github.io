title: August Maptime - An Intro to QGIS: Make a Map
rsvp: http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-Boston/events/196455702/
---

This is our third Maptime Boston Meetup. We are going to get into QGIS (formerly known as Quantum GIS). QGIS is free, open-source, and highly capable GIS software. If you've ever been curious about QGIS and want to learn more, or never even heard of it, join us! We are going to go through some of the basics of using the QGIS software, including adding data, projecting data, symbolizing and map design, and geoprocessing.

If you've been using QGIS for years, come and lend your expertise to help others get started and answer questions. 

Look for more information, including how to download the software, to be posted soon.

**Beginners are encouraged, and be sure bring your laptop.**
